Is  Disability  Insurance  Required  By  Law?," Not generally. There are five states that require most all employers carry short term disability insurance on their employees. These states are: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Besides this mandatory short term disability law, there is no other legislative imperative for someone to purchase or be covered by disability insurance."
Can  Creditors  Take  Life  Insurance  After  Death?," If the person who passed away was the one with the debt, creditors generally cannot take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was a person. The money then belongs to that beneficiary, and as long as creditors do not have a claim against the beneficiary, they cannot take life insurance proceeds from them."
Does  Travelers  Insurance  Have  Renters  Insurance?," One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes, you can purchase Renters insurance through Travelers. I would look for a local agent who can assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested. I am sure the local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other carries as well."
Can  I  Drive  A  New  Car  Home  Without  Insurance?," Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car. It is never a good idea to drive a car without insurance. If you traded a car in, then the coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily, but you need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed. Most dealerships have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well."
Is  The  Cash  Surrender  Value  Of  Life  Insurance  Taxable?," Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance, never with Term. It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive. That amount includes both what you put in and what profit you made. The profit is taxable, just as most profit would be taxable. A far better idea would be NOT to surrender your Whole Life Policy, but instead to keep it and borrow against it and either then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish. You continue to grow in value, even when the loan is out, and your policy stays in force, although the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back. There are numerous option you should discuss with a qualified agent. Gary Lane, Registered Representative, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Call anytime. Thank you."
How  Is  Annuity  Income  Reported?," The good news is that annuity income is usually reported by the insurance company issuing the annuity. When they make a disbursement they also issue appropriate documentation to assist in filing your taxes. They send identical information to the Internal Revenue Service. Generally speaking when money is withdrawn from an annuity it is treated as interest and then taxed as ordinary income until the interest is exhausted and only the basis (the sum of premiums paid) remains. That money can be recovered free of income tax. If the annuity is annuitized, that is paid out in monthly installments either over an extended period of time or the lifetime of the annuitant, then an exclusion factor is determined and applied to each payment. A part of each payment will be taxed as ordinary income. The bad news is that these principles apply to non-qualified annuities held by individuals and these barely touch all the situations that can arise and the taxation of those unique situations. While this response is not meant to take the place of legal and accounting professional advice it should alert you to some of the complexities of taxing annuities. The most obvious situation is when an annuity is held as an asset of qualified pension plan. This includes defined benefit plans. defined contribution plans (401(k), IRAs and many others. The income taken by these plans is taxed as ordinary income unless it is taken prior to age fifty-nine and a half. If taken earlier it could be subject to a penalty tax of an additional ten per cent. Where annuities taxation becomes complex is when deferred annuities are transferred. That is when a person gives another person an annuity on their life, or the life of a third party. The basic rule is that the transfer is treated as surrender and taxed accordingly. The annuity that is transferred is treated as having been fully paid. It then has a basis of the value that was taxed. For estate planning reasons the ownership of an annuity is sometimes held by a trust and this leads to another set of taxation considerations involving the non-natural person rule. Who is going to be taxed is the basic issue and this can be quite tangled. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules. Taxation is fairly straightforward if the annuity is annuitized. State laws concerning probate can create some unexpected outcomes and taxation. When an individual owns an annuity and the annuitant is another person, perhaps a spouse, the death of the owner triggers the beneficiary provision and another third person could suddenly own the contract upsetting the intentions of the couple, even if it is a child. Many of the taxation rules are specific to individual insurance companies and it is wise to carefully make sure that the company you select from whom to purchase the annuity follows the procedures that will maintain your plan and keep taxation as uncomplicated as possible. Absent all other plans, the IRS frequently calls for a liquidation of a transferred annuity within five years. The key is the desire to get the tax question settled."
What  Does  AAA  Home  Insurance  Cover?," AAA Home insurance, like all other major carriers, covers a wide variety of claims, including fire, theft, vandalism, and many other items. However, there are numerous types of policies offered, so it is best to determine the type of policy you have to accurately understand all of the benefits. An experienced broker can help."
What  Is  A  Simple  Retirement  Plan?," what is a SIMPLE retirement plan? A Simple is an inexpensive opportunity for a small business to have a retirement plan that doesn't break the bank in advisor fees. A Simple plan is an IRS approved plan with only a few steps to follow so expensive testing and record keeping aren't necessary. For any small business who are considering a retirement plan to offer, this should be right on top as it does provide a great platform for a business who would rather use it's money to put towards employees retirements rather than third party administers plans."

Does  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Lost  Wedding  Ring?," Great question. Generally no, your Homeowners' policy will not cover for anything that is lost. This is referred to as Mysterious Disappearance in your policy documents and is usually listed as a specific exclusion. That having been said, you can certainly obtain coverage for such a loss by working with your insurance professional and asking that the item be insured specifically either as a rider which is attached to your Homeowners' policy or as a stand alone separate policy. You will need to provide a current appraisal and the item would be insured to the stated amount on the appraisal. Such riders or separate policies (commonly referred to as Personal Inland Marine) include much broader coverage than does a standard Homeowners policy and will cover for such a loss."
How  Does  Assigned  Risk  Auto  Insurance  Work?, Assigned risk in California which is what I amfamiliarwith is a processing center by which people having trouble buying auto insurance are connected with an insurance company that will insure them. Assigned Risk is not an insurance company but are companies that are required by law to participate. The amount of autos an insurance company has on the road would constitute the percentage of their obligation to the plan. There is financial hardship criteria to qualify for Assigned Risk. Also agents who offer Assigned Risk must becertifiedto offer this coverage. You can go online and then beconnectedto an agent to see if you qualify for assigned risk.
Can  My  Boyfriend  Add  Me  To  His  Car  Insurance?, If you are living in the same household then he should put you on the list of drivers. The insurance follows the car and that is linked to a household. The person buying the insurance is in the household and can loan the car to whoever he wishes. The insurance covers the automobile. If you are not living together there wouldnt be anything gained by putting you on the policy.
Do  I  Need  A  Police  Report  To  Submit  A  Claim  For  A  Car  Accident  On  Private  Property?," Actually, though the local police might prepare an accident report for you, in many cases, because the incident occured on private property, it is more likely that they would take no action at all. Therefore, if it is possible, it becomes more important to exchange information with the other party involved. I would also recommend that neither car be moved and that you take photos for your records and that of your Insurance Company to help in the processing of the claim."
Does  Full  Coverage  Auto  Insurance  Cover  Repairs?," By Full Coverage I am assuming you mean, does carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage cover repairs? If you have a covered claim i.e. -an accident, hit a deer, backed into your wife's car like I did the other week - then yes, carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage would pay to fix those covered damages subject to your poilcy deductible. If you are experiencing general vehicle issues, i.e. - motor running roof, transmission mission or other general wear and tear - no, your insurance coverage would not come into play in these cases. Insurance only comes into play to repair a vehilce when there is a covered claim."
Is  Life  Insurance  Acceptable  In  Islam?," Do to its use of interest and chance there are those who believe that insurance is not permitted in Islam (i.e. that it is haram or sinful). Due to the spiritual nature of this question, you should seek the advice of an Imam for further guidance on Islam's position on insurance."
Will  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tubal  Reversal?," Most insurance plans will not cover the reversal of a voluntary sterilization or any treatments designed to overcome infertility. There are fifteen states with insurance mandates requiring some form of coverage for infertility, but every one of these mandates specifically excludes covering reversal surgeries. The best alternative is to take advantage of the tax deductible expenses, and to buy extra coverage for any resulting pregnancy: lower deductible health insurance, short term disability, hospital indemnity."
How  Much  Life  Insurance  Can  You  Get  If  You  Have  Been  Diagnosed  With  Breast  Cancer?," Traditionally, you can get up to 20-30x your income level of life insurance. The medical history does not necessarily limit how much you can get. The medical history determines the risk classification which controls the premiums for the coverage you want to put in place. When it comes to breast cancer, the details of the medical condition will determine which carriers will offer coverage and what the risk classification would be (each carrier has different underwriting, you may not get the same risk class offer from each of them), The best thing to do is to shop the case via an independent insurance agent/broker who can shop it to multiple companies. You do NOT want to apply to multiple companies as this can work against you due to the MIB (Medical Information Bureau) - from a company's point of view, it's sort of like a red flag if you will if they saw you applied to multiple companies which they can check the MIB for. In order to secure the most accurate quotes for the coverage, a number of factors would need to be known such as when the cancer was diagnosed, what stage is it in/was it in, how was it treated, has treatment been completed, are there anymore tests scheduled or that need to be completed, are you being treated for any other conditions, what prescriptions do you take, family medical history, and other factors. If you have a copy of the pathology report, that will help with a lot of the input. If cancer is current, guaranteed-issue whole life (GIWL) will be the only type of coverage available as it doesn't have any medical questions or exam requirements. However, the amount of coverage available under a single policy is $20,000-$25,000, depending on the carrier. To get more than that, you would need to stack multiple policies. Under GIWL policies, they traditionally feature a 2 or 3 year graded period - meaning you only have accidental death coverage during those periods, otherwise the carrier just returns the premiums paid into the policy if death occurs during the graded period. After the graded period expires, the full benefit is payable. Carriers typically only issue fully-underwritten coverage if the cancer has been in remission/treatment completed for at least 2 years. Many carriers prefer 5+ years from the date treatment was completed for a more favorable risk class. Send me a message via the contact me button by my profile picture if you would like me to assist with your coverage. My group is licensed with about 50 different carriers in numerous states. I hope the information is helpful - please let me know how I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
What  Do  I  Need  To  Register  For  Medicare?, If you have paid taxes into the system then enrollment is automatic. You should receive your Medicare card and a packet of information from Medicare shortly before you turn 65 or qualify for Medicare if you are on disability. If you do not receive your card by the time you turn 65 then you need to call your Social Security office or 1-800-MEDICARE.
Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Work?," Short-term Disability does work if you have a qualifying disability. When you are applying for short or long-term disability, you need to look at the definition of disability and occupation. Not all companies have the same definition. If the definition is vague, you may find yourself being denied on your claim or receiving a lesser amount then what you have applied for."
Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Pool?," In short, the answer is yes. But it needs to be clarified whether you are asking for property damage to the pool itself or liability coverage. Both would be covered barring any specific pool exclusions, which I am not aware of any in the standard market. If someone were to get injured while swimming in the pool, yes, your homeowners policy should cover you for liability. Likewise, if you pool is damaged due to the standard homeowners causes of loss less any standard exclusions then the pool would be covered for property damage to the pool itself. Keep in mind that wear and tear would not be covered under your policy. So if your pool liner rips just because or the concrete foundation cracks, those would be considered wear and tear. Please note that many insurance carriers are very cautious when writing homeowners insurance on homes that have pools. Some do not like to write them with a pool exposure, some do not mind, so be sure to ask your agent how it might affect your current coverage and future coverage and what the premium impact might be. You also want to strongly consider higher liability limits in purchasing an umbrella or if you already have an umbrella policy then higher umbrella limits. It might cost you $150 for each additional $1 mil limit. Lastly, if you have a pool and want to make sure you are covered for the proper limits, make sure your coverage B (other structures) limit is sufficient to cover any losses to your pool and any other structures i.e. detached garages, sheds as well."
When  Do  I  Have  To  Sign  Up  For  Medicare?," You should sign up for Medicare in the three months before the month of your 65th birthday, the month of your 65th birthday, or in the three months following the month of your 65th birthday. If you miss that enrollment period you can sign up between Jan 1 and March 31 each year."
Will  An  MIP  Affect  My  Car  Insurance?," That is a great question! If you are the minor in question with the possession charge, you better bet it will. If the minor was someone in your car with you, and not you, you might get lucky and the insurance company won't find out. Now the fact that you were allowing the breaking of the law, suggests that your decision making skills need some work, and that as a result, at some point yes, that will affect your policy, as you will most likely be filing some claims. Please consider this a serious wake up call. Too many teenagers die as a result of drunk driving, and you don't ( and neither does anyone else on the road with you) need to be another sad statistic. Seriously, stop. Thanks for asking."
Does  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  Have  Life  Insurance?," Blue Cross / Blue Shield is the name of the network association for a number of health insurance companies (includes Anthem and CareFirst). Many health insurance companies do also offer life insurance programs, however, it's typically not the type of coverage they specialize in and the products may therefore not be as competitive as insurance companies who feature life insurance programs as the main type of insurance they offer. Insurance companies specializing in life insurance tend to have more aggressive underwriting and can offer lower rates because they want to secure that type of business more than others. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
What  Are  The  Advantages  And  Disadvantages  To  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?," The advantages of coverage in your senior years can be significant based on the average senior couple spending $250,000 in medical costs during their retirement years. The disadvantage is the loss of economic opportunity to invest or save the premium dollars spent on long term care insurance if you never use it."
Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Life  Alert?, Medicare covers items that are considered medically necessary. This includes diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions caused by accident or illness. Medicare will also cover some DME (durable medical equipment) if prescribed by a doctor as part of your treatment plan. Services such as Life Alert are not considered medically necessary.
Which  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?," Product suitability is always a consideration when considering product lines that have such diverse application. Life insurance is generally purchased for indemnification or inheritance planning, but can be used as supplemental retirement income. Term life insurance is an excellent for temporary coverage for temporary financial exposure to your beneficiaries. For permanent liabilities, many planners use guaranteed universal life insurance. For supplemental retirement income there are several crediting methods: for interest rate crediting you can use participating whole life or current assumption universal life. If you desire access to domestic and/or foreign indices, you should review indexed universal life insurance. If your risk tolerance permits, you could consider variable universal life with access to separate sub accounts that use marker equities and bond instruments."
Does  Medicare  Pay  For  HPV  Screening?," Medicare covers your annual exams including most women's gynocological exams and testing. As part of your pelvic exam and pap test, your doctor should screen for abnormalities including STD's, abnormal cells and HPV. The HPV virus has been linked to certain types of cervical cancer. You should have regular HPV screening and it is normally covered by Medicare"
Which  Is  The  Best  Life  Insurance  To  Get?," The best life insurance to get is going to depend on many factors. The most prominent one being why are you taking out the policy. Otherwise, I would say a whole life policy is the one that will provide a lot of bang for the buck in most cases. To ensure that you get the policy that is right for you contact your local agent and discuss your needs and expectations so that they can direct you to the policy that best fits."
How  Much  Should  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Cost?," Long term care insurance premiums will vary greatly according to age, health, features of the policy, and area in which the policy is purchased. However, you could look at the federal guidelines for how much premium can be exempted on income tax returns, to get a general guide for life insurance premiums. In 2013, they are: 40 and under: $360/single, $720/couple 41-50: $680/single, $1,360/couple 51-60: $1,360/single, $2,720/couple 61-70: $3,640/single, $7,280/couple 71 and up: $4,550/single, $9,100/couple"
How  Safe  Are  Fixed  Annuities?," Tax deferred, fixed annuities are based on the contractual claims in the annuity policy. The contractual claims in the annuity policy are as good as the financial strength and claims paying of the annuity company that issued the policy. Generally, fixed interest rate annuities guarantee a rate for a period of time like 5, 7 or 10 years. The annuity insurance companys portfolio is generally dominated by government bonds."
How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Settle  A  Life  Insurance  Claim?," Life insurance death claims are generally filed by the beneficiaries of the policy. The beneficiaries contact the insurance company for their death claim forms and return them with an obituary and certificate of death. The process should take between 30 and 60 days. If the death occurred within the two year contestability period, a standard investigation will ensue which can delay payment."
Is  Car  Insurance  Credit  Checked?, When you are applying for auto insurance coverage most if not all insurance carriers will do what is called a soft pull of an insured's credit score. This soft pull normally will not adversely affect a persons credit rating. Credit score is only one part of the many factors that are taken into consideration when your rate is calculated.
Can  I  Use  HSA  To  Pay  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?," Yes, you can use HSA to pay for long term care insurance premiums. There is a limit on the premiums for LTC insurance that can be paid through your health savings account. The instructions for your Section A (Form 1040) of your tax return will tell you the limit of premiums that can be deducted for your age group that year."
Can  Employers  Charge  Smokers  More  For  Health  Insurance?," Yes. Application of a premium surcharge for tobacco users has become more common in recent years, primarily in larger groups who self-fund their employee benefits plans as the employer has much more control of the benefit plan design and rate structure than they do with fully insured plans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), while doing away with pre-existing condition exclusions, does explicitly allow for the adjustment of rates for tobacco use. So, in that sense, tobacco users are the class of employees it is legal to discriminate or penalize for their personal behavior. The ACA is silent on the consumption of Marijuana which may present some interesting situations as more states move to allow the use of medical Marijuana or to legalize its recreational use."
What  Does  Home  Owners  Insurance  Usually  Cover?," That's kind of a tough question to answer becuase many homeowners policies cover a multitude of things. In general terms if you house catches on fire, is broken into, is damaged by wind hail or lightning, your pipes burst, some body trips and falls on your proprty and gets hurt you could have a claims situation on your homeowners policy. This is just scratching the surface as every policy is different in every state. Most carriers add in a bunch of extra coverages too. To truly know what your homeowners policy covers, you need to do two things 1) Call you local independent agent and discuss you policy with them 2) Actually read your policy. I know reading a legal contract is your idea of fun night curled up by the fire, but it is in your best interest to actually read your entire policy, know what it includes and excludes and ask your agent about things you have questions on...."
How  Much  Does  An  Ultrasound  Cost  Without  Health  Insurance?, Ultrasound exams are usually a few hundred dollars when you have health insurance. The Health Care Blue Book shows a price of $158 for an abdominal ultrasound including physician fees. Ultrasound on other body parts may be more or less. You should ask your doctor about costs in advance and negotiate an acceptable rate.
What  Is  10  Yr  Term  Life  Insurance?," That is a great question! A ten year term policy is one that provides you with the specified amount of coverage for the ten years as defined in your policy. On the day your policy expires, you have no more coverage, and no cash value or benefit to take from it. You can renew your policy, but it will dramatically increase in price. Typically a policy like this is to insure against a short term loss, like covering a college career, or a mortgage, or to provide a cheaper form of life insurance when money is tight. If you would like more details, please feel free to contact me, okay? Thanks for asking!"
Can  You  Put  Money  In  A  401K  And  A  Roth  IRA?," That is an excellent question! Not only can you, but you should! It is an excellent strategy to maximize as much as you can afford to the amount you can contribute to your retirement funds. Contribute as much as you can to the 401 to earn the employer match, it's free money, in a way, and you should take advantage of it. Your Roth will allow $5500 a year ($6500 if you are 50+) and after your 401, contribute as much of that as possible. The earlier you start, the better, and by maximizing your contributions now, it will help balance out when the time comes that money is a little tighter, and you can't contribute as much. Thank you for asking!"
Can  I  Get  Health  Insurance  With  Hepatitis  C?," You can purchase health insurance with Hepatitis C as a preexisting medical condition. There would be no waiting period before benefits begin, but time is quickly running out. The Affordable Care Act requires that health plans accept all applicants regardless of existing medical conditions. Applicants need to enroll in a plan during the annual open enrollment period through their state insurance exchange. The first open enrollment ends on March 31 of 2014 - in just a few days. Coverage would begin April 1. If you miss this open enrollment window you could enroll in plans with a January 1, 2015 effective date."
When  Can  I  Enroll  In  Medicare  Part  A?," You will automatically be enrolled in Medicare when you reach age 65 provided you have worked long enough and paid into the system. You will have the choice to opt out of part B of Medicare, but I do not recommend it unless you are still working and in a group. You will also get Medicare if you are on Social Security Disability. There is about a two year wait when you get disability before you are eligible."
When  Did  Health  Insurance  Originate?," That is a great question! There were some types of travelers insurances offered in the 1840's that covered you if your train crashed or steamboat sank, but other than that, there really wasn't much until the late 1800's when disability policies became popular. Britain passed a law in the early 1900's that created a National Health Insurance, and most of Europe kind of adopted similar laws, but we didn't catch on until 1929 when us Texans ( Baylor University Hospital, and some local teachers, I think) created a system of standardized costs for hospital stays. Shortly thereafter came Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and then all kinds of competing companies. The history of insurance is interesting stuff. Thanks for asking!"
How  Important  Is  Health  Care  Insurance?," Very important. Health insurance allows people to go and get health care if needed. Typically people with insurance will get check ups, find problems sooner due to early detection and can address health needs proactively. When you don't have health insurance you spend your days praying you never get sick. If at all possible strive to keep health insurance on yourself and your family."
How  Much  Does  It  Cost  To  Get  Renters  Insurance?," Great question. Often clients are afraid to ask I think they believe is it expensive but actually its relatively inexpensive. Typically if you insure two vehicles with a company the discount you gain by having a second policy on your auto insurance will if not cover the cost of a renters policy it will be close! So the average cost is 60-120 dollars a year. So for ten dollars or less you have coverage for your phone, computers, books, clothes, medications, cd's, movies, art, guns or whatever else you own! Ten dollars a month is very inexpensive, also these are covered anywhere in the world!"
Does  My  Home  Insurance  Cover  Theft?," It is important to talk to your insurance professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy, but generally speaking, theft is a named covered peril in most Home Insurance policies. This would include theft of your personal property from within your home of course, but also includes theft of your property outside of your home. Personal property outside of your home is usually covered up to 10% of the total personal property amount listed in your policy. If covered, the loss settlement would be subject to your deductible. The claims specialist will also be looking for a copy or a police report."
How  Does  Renters  Insurance  Benefit  The  Landlord?," That is a great question! The landlord needs to provide a safe environment for the tenants, and carries insurance on the property. To help protect the property manager/complex from a higher liability, your renters policy helps take some of that liability off of their shoulders. If you damage the apartment, or someone is injured in your apartment, your policy covers some or all of that claim, and not the landlords. Thanks for asking!"
Do  Ohio  Employers  Have  To  Offer  Health  Insurance?," Employers in Ohio are required to offer health insurance to their workers although they can avoid any penalty if the family can not afford the healthcare benefits offered. Also, this penalty has been delayed until 2015 to give employers and insurers time to work on specific details of implementation. This tax penalty applies to companies with 50 or more workers and applies to workers and their dependents, including children under the age of 26. Technically, the law does not apply to spouses. Full-time would be considered working 30 hours per week. However, having 100 part-time workers working 20 hours per week would qualify as having 50 full-time workers. Here in Ohio, we have enjoyed low health insurance rates, and although required mandates will be raising premiums, there still will be many low-cost options.Most of the major insurers, including Anthem and Medical Mutual, will be participating in the State Health Exchange."
How  Much  Auto  Insurance  Should  I  Have?," I always recommend the highest limits of liability that you can afford. If you have a good insurance score, and a clean driving record, the premium difference between 50/100 (50k per person/100k per accident) and 100/300 will not be much relatively speaking. Also, it is a good idea to have a high limit of liability for property damage, such as $100,000. The national average vehicle liability award in 2008 was $326,628. That said, I always recommend at least 250/500 limits of liability. Additionally, I always recommend having an umbrella policy to increase your limits of liability. Ask your insurance agent for a quote on a $1,000,000 umbrella policy. Be sure to tell your agent of all properties or vehicles titled to you."
Why  Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Increase?," Homeowners Insurance is a contract whereby a homeowner transfers his/her risk to an insurance carrier in return for a contract and a small premium. Homeowners Insurance Premium will usually increase from year to year. however, by chance a decrease may be seen once in a while. Insurance companies increase the Dwelling Coverage each year to keep up with the increasing cost of reconstruction. after all, homeowners insurance's primary purpose is to rebuild a home in the unfortunate event of a total loss. The small increase of dwelling coverage each year is usually the purpose that draws attention when the premium rises. however, this is very insignificant. Insurance companies are audited each year and are obligated to comply with State Department of Insurance regulations in each and every State where they underwrite risk. Each year, insurance carriers calculate the necessary premium to maintain a safe financial condition and offer security to all homes insured. the largest reason for premium increase would be 'loss experience' during the prior year, another reason may be due to increased operational cost including but definitely not limited to reinsurance premium paid. Insurance Companies either have an internal actuarial department or hire an independent actuarial firm who are charged with the responsibility of calculating premium based on underwriting factors and prior loss data. For this reason, carriers only offer annual policies and are unable to predict risk on a longer term basis. Since carriers experience different loss results each and every year, insurance rates and increase percentages are never the same from one year to the next. Since paid losses continue to grow, claim frequency is showing growth and litigation is becoming more commonplace, insurance companies raise premium to keep up with the outflow of payments. It is important to recognize that claims and operational expenses are paid from the pool of collected policy premium. For a more detailed explanation or financial report from your current carrier, contact your carrier representative to receive a report. Also, data is available as published by the Department of Insurance in most States."
Who  Can  Buy  Medicare?," That is a great question! The vast majority of people get Medicare when they are turning 65. The program will allow people under the age of 65 to enroll under certain conditions, like kidney failure, or if you have been on disability for a designated amount of time. The program is designed to help Senior Citizens afford health care, so unless you meet the exceptions, you will need to be 65 or older to enroll. Thanks for asking!"
How  To  Remove  Medicare  Part  B?," --> Medicare makes it difficult to cancel, or withdraw from, Medicare Part B.

Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Option?," The answer to any financial question should always be prefaced by it depends on the need of the individual. That said, there are significant benefits for someone who owns a whole life participating policy. Whole life, a form of permanent life insurance, features guaranteed premiums, death benefits and cash value. Whole life policies also give you the potential to receive dividends which can increase the value of the policy or provide an increased death benefit for beneficiaries. Unlike term, the death benefit will last your entire lifetime and the monthly premium will be locked in at the date of policy inception according to your rating. So, if you are 35 and get rated Preferred Non-tobacco that will give you a monthly premium that will not change for your entire life, regardless of any health issues - as long as your premiums are current. The second important value of whole life insurance is the accumulation of cash inside the policy on a tax-deferred basis. Over time, the cash value increases can be significant and you can borrow cash from your policy at a favorable interest rate. Many people have used this as a source for college funding or even a retirement income stream later in life. These policy loans are generally tax free.

For example, it is not uncommon for an employer to contribute on dollar or percentage amount towards the coverage of salaried employees and another dollar or percentage amount towards hourly employees. This is quite common where a labor union collectively bargained agreement is in place. Where an employer can get in trouble is where they choose to discriminate within the same class of employees. So, as a general rule all salaried employees should be treated the same from an employer contribution standpoint as should be the case with all hourly employees. Contributing 50% of the cost for one salaried employee and 75% of the cost for another similarly situated salariedemployee could be the grounds for a labor discrimination lawsuit for the employer."
What  Will  Happen  To  Medicare  In  The  Future?," Medicare is too big to fail but that does not mean there won't be changes.

What's  Covered  In  Homeowners  Insurance?," Let me add a few comments here on how the coverages are usually presented on a Declaration page of a Homeowners policy. First there is the party being insured and who the company is that is providing the insurance. Then there is a specific term for the coverage to begin and end. Then there are many ways to then itemize the coverage, but here are some basics. The policy is usually divided into two Sections .Section I deals with property insurance and Section II Liability Insurance, so within the section I coverages there are usually four parts Coverages A,B, C, D. Coverage A is the Dwelling Coverage. This can be sold on an Actual cash value basis ( very infrequently, but watch out for it ) usually on a 100 % of the dollar value of the estimated cost to replace the house itself. This is often difficult for consumers to understand, but no one really cares about the market value. What is important is the replacement cost and replacing one house destroyed is usually a lot more expensive then building one new in a subdivision. Make sure you have enough coverage. This is not an exact science so many companies offer extensions to increase the coverage beyond the stated value. Next is Coverage B : These are the other structures appurtenant, outbuildings, fences, Gazebos unattached garages etc. Coverage C is usually Personal Property or Contents Coverage. This is very important to understand :You want replacement cost coverage not Actual Cash Value, ACV. The easiest way to think of this is the ten your old large and 200 lb TV. The ACV is going to be next to nothing. There is no continuing interest in buying that type TV anywhere. But replacing it with a new TV with light weight plasma features is what you want. Coverage D is Additional Living Expense. This can be stated two different ways or a mixture of the two. Some companies list a maximum dollar limit available. Others list a maximum time limit and still others list a maximum time limit and dollar limit. This covers the additional cost of living elsewhere while your home is reconstructed. It can also come into play if a Governmental authority won't let you near your home for safety reasons ( i.e. forced evacuation form an impending hurricane).This coverage does not pick up the cost of things you would normally pay out of pocket, but the additional things and costs necessary to keep your household going while your home is repaired. The next set of coverages comprise Section II or liability coverage. Coverage E is very broad and covers such things as an injury to a child by your dog, or an inadvertent collapse of you deck with guests on it etc. Coverage E then is is sold in increments of 100,000 usually. The difference in price from say 300,000 to 500,000 is usually only a few dollars a year. If you have an umbrella policy, you may be required to carry a minimum of 500,000 in coverage. Coverage F is Medical payments coverage. This is usually quite nominal and is used to cover minor incidents where fault may not be much of an issue, but you feel obliged to pay for the medical bill. For example a neighbor picks up your mail for you while you are gone and trips on your garden hose. The injuries are not serious, but do require a couple stitches . The limit is low because the much more serious incidents would require negligence or absolute liability and would fall under Coverage E. I hope this helps. If you are in AZ.CA,TX, MO, or GA we'll be glad to assist you with placing your homeowners coverage."

The basic benefits are: 1) Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up. 2) Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3) First 3 pints of blood 4) Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment There's a total of 9 benefits that can be secured. The other 5 benefits available under a Medigap plan are: 1) Skilled Nursing Facility Care coinsurance 2) Medicare Part A deductible 3) Medicare Part B deductible 4) Medicare Part B excess charges 5) Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits) Each plan features a different structure, Each plan covers a different combination of these 9 benefits (some of the plans feature coinsurance or copayments for certain benefits). If cost is not a major factor for you, Plan F will be the recommended choice because it covers all 9 benefits at 100% - it's the most popular plan by far. If you're looking to keep your costs down, but still have very comprehensive coverage, you may want to look at plans C, G, and N as well. When you're looking to buy a Medigap plan, you should consult with an independent Medigap insurance agent to review the plans in detail to see which one will best serve your needs, help you identify all of the carriers offering Medigap plans in your zip code, and which one will be able to offer the coverage to you at the lowest cost (the plans are standardized so the biggest difference between them is price - the benefits are exactly the same regardless of the carrier you have the Medigap plan through). I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
How  To  Add  A  Dependent  To  Health  Insurance?," Dependent children can be covered under their parent's health insurance policies up to age 26. The main questions are the timing of your wanting to add this dependent to your coverage or if a change of life status event has occurred that allows for the addition of a dependent to your policy. If it's renewal time for your coverage then it's simply a matter of requesting the paperwork to add thedependent to your coverage. In the context of group health insurance plans it is quite likely that if it is outside of your plan's open enrollment period that a change of life status event will have to occur for you to be able to add your dependent to your coverage. The most common change of life status events are marriage, divorce, birth of a child, adoption of a child or loss of other health insurance coverage. If you had the dependent during your last open enrollment period and did not add them to your group's policy at that timeand there has been no change of life status event in the interim you will almost certainly have to wait until your group's next open enrollment period. Also, in one of the quirks of ObamaCare, spouses are not technically defined as dependents (I know, it doesn't make any sense but remember our politicians didn't read the law before they passed it). So, with health insurance rates rising sharply you are seeing more employers not providing spousal coverage, or allowing spouses to be covered only of they do not have coverage available through their employers (if they have one), or you may see an extra charge assessed for covering a spouse that has crappy coverage elsewhere. Just a word of warning regarding possible surprises you might encounter in wanting to add a spouse to your coverage."

The whole life policy doesnt increase in cost just at the time that you need it."

Every auto insurance carrier that I am aware of requires a drivers license number of all drivers that are to be covered by a policy.

The benefits of Obamacare are only available to those under the age of 65, which basically equates to this law taking money away from caring for our nation's seniors to secure coverage for younger individuals, at least those younger Americans that do not make enough income to cover the cost of coverage themselves."

If at the time that you completed the application you answered that truthfully and the company did not exclude skydiving from your policy, you are probably covered.

Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  Skin  Removal  Surgery?," It will depend upon your medical situation. 1) No Scenario (the most likely) - the skin removal is for cosmetic purposes. This is generally understood to extend to persons who have meaningful weight loss that leaves them with excess skin. So, you may have done the right thing by losing a lot of weight but you may have to reconcile yourself to living longer with a flabbier body or privately pay for cosmetic surgery. 2) Yes Scenario (uncommon but not rare) - where medically necessary criteria are met. There are circumstances where there can be recurring health problems caused by skin overhang (yeast infections, sores and rashes, infections, etc.) that can be remedied or mitigated by removing the overhanging skin, a Panniculectomy. This is not the same procedure as what is commonly referred to as a tummy tuck. The Punniculectomy only removes the overhanging skin and does not address the stretching of abdominal muscle that can also occur and which is commonly addressed in the tummy tuck procedure. As such, depending upon the terms of your policy and how a claim is coded I can foresee the situation where both procedures are performed (if the doctors went on and did the more invasive abdominal muscle procedures while they were in there and this was done with your prior consent or request) and part of the procedureis covered by the policy and the other part being deemed for cosmetic purposesand not being covered."

Can  You  Surrender  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," You certainly can surrender a policy for its cash value, but then you have no life insurance. It would be much better for most folks to just borrow money from their policy and either pay it back or not. With a surrender, you will have to pay tax, but with a loan you will not, even if you do not pay it back, and you would still have a smaller but existing life insurance policy. Pay it back later and the death benefit returns automatically to the full amount! Call me, Gary Lane, Agent, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thanks."

How  Much  Of  Your  Salary  Is  Covered  By  Disability  Insurance?," Along with what Peggy said, it's important to note that you can always receive more benefit when you start making more money. Some people think, Oh, I don't want to buy it now because I'll be making more money in a few years. Don't make that mistake!

Children can be covered under their parent's health plan up to age 26.

Can  I  Pay  Health  Insurance  Premiums  With  Fsa?," Can you pay health insurance premiums with a Flexible Spending Account? I guess the first thing I would ask is if you have a FSA in place, aren't your premiums already being deducted pre-tax? I don't know of any business situation that offers a FSA plan that doesn't already have employee paid premiums already taken pre-tax. Do you mean health insurance premiums for another family member who is not part of your employer's plan? I believe the answer would be no. FSA in regard to medical, dental and vision expenses are designed to pay towards out of pocket expenses a person has during a plan year."
Does  Walmart  Take  Medicare?," Walmart does accept Medicare Part B.

Walmart also is a participating provider in most Medicare Part D plans, and you can purchase drugs covered under Medicare Part D in a Walmart pharmacy."
Can  Auto  Insurance  Be  Transferred?," Generally, an insurance policy cannot be transferred or assigned. Every personal auto policy I can remember reading prohibits assignment of the policy without the written consent of the insurance carrier. That makes sense because the carrier has a right to choose their customers and since it is their money providing the coverage, they have a right to consider any change of risk. As a general rule it makes more sense for a new policy to be written because even if the carrier consents to the change the new insured inherits the record of that policy including all the claims and payment history. If the coverage is being transferred between a spouse to another spouse after a death, the companies are not in the habit of denying the request to change the first named insured. Otherwise, per the ISO Personal Auto Policy, Assignment of this policy will not be valid unless we give our written consent. The answer is no but there is a pathway to a yes if the carrier consents in writing."
What  Does  SR22  Insurance  Cover?," An SR22 is nothing more than an administrative trail of the status of your auto insurance coverage. The form is filed because the State licensing agency has determined a need to be aware of the status of your coverage, usually due to failing to have insurance or having committed any of several offenses of driving laws. An SR22 is merely attached to your insurance record and your carrier agrees to submit status updates to your state bureau of motor vehicles. An SR22 does not provide any coverage."
Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  Without  A  Job?," Yes, as long as you are able to pay your premiums on time. I am not aware of a carrier that asks for a persons employer name or even employment status when they are applying to receive automobile insurance coverage. If you are able to make your insurance premium payments on time the insurance carrier will more than likely provide you coverage for as long as you wish to be provided coverage."
How  Often  Do  You  Pay  Health  Insurance?," That is a great question! As a rule, most insurance premiumpayments are paid on a monthly basis. Some, like your auto or life insurance policies, can also be paid on a quarterly, semi-annual (every six months) or annually. Health insurance though, as a rule is typically a monthly payment, though your provider may also allow for other payment schedules. Thanks for asking!"
When  Does  The  Beneficiary  Collect  From  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," The beneficiary collects from a life insurance policy after the insured person dies.

If  I  Don't  Have  Auto  Insurance  Can  I  Rent  A  Car?," Car rental agencies offer insurance coverage for the duration of the rental period. Check with them as to coverages and premiums.

The good thing about insurance through the rental company when if an accident occurs, their insurance relieves you of further responsibility."

When  Is  Home  Warranty  Insurance  Required?, Home Warranty is not required but I highly recommend it. Home Warranty is different from homeowners in that it can cover to fix or replace equipment in your home such as your HVAC Systems or pool equipment.

Be sure to research the companies so that you can get a good idea of how they treat these claims

The Insurance Services Office publishes Insurance Forms which are basic coverage contracts sold asinsurance policies by insurance companies. Homeowners Insurance is the most common form of Property Insurance. this form is generally written for Owner Occupied Single Family Homes but in some cases, it could apply to an Owner Occupied Duplex. To complicate matters further, mortgage companies do not differentiate the coverage form. they simply define required insurance as 'Hazard Insurance'. the hazard being the risk or collateral against which the mortgage company has leant funds.

So whatever your credit score was before you apply for insurance is what it will be after applying. To my knowledge, California is one of the states that mandates insurance companies not take a person's credit history into consideration when rating the premium. You can check with an insurance agent or broker licensed in your state to see if your state as the same rules."

Can  You  Get  Health  Insurance  As  A  Real  Estate  Agent?," My sick sense of humor almost tempts me to say No, real estate agents are specifically excluded from getting health insurance by law but I won't do that. Yes, you can get health insurance. What you do for a living has no bearing on your eligibility for health insurance, especially now that ObamaCare is in full effect regarding guaranteed issuance of policies. In my experience, most real estate agents are self-employed/1099 contractor status people and not W2 employees of an agency. So, this probably means that you will need to get individual health insurance either through your state's government health insurance marketplace or outside of it. So, just like you would tell those For Sale By Owner folks, you need to seek out an experienced health insurance agent who can assist you in obtaining coverage. If you have been without health insurance for more than 60-days and haven't had what is called a change of life status event (marriage, divorce, childbirth/adoption, loss of other coverage) then you are in a time frame where you would be ineligible for enrollment in true major medical insurance until the next annual open enrollment period begins on November 15th, 2014 and the earliest your coverage could go into effect would be for January 1st, 2015. I hate to be the one to deliver this news but that is how ObamaCare works. Your only coverage option to carry you through until then would be to take out a Short Term Medical insurance plan. There are a variety of short term medical plan options available. However, you need to be aware that short term medical plans do still use limited underwriting questions, can decline a person for coverage and they do not cover pre-existing conditions. Please feel free to contact me if you need advice or assistance in this matter."
When  Is  Open  Enrollment  For  Medigap  Policies?," You can apply for a Medigap plan up to 3 months before your Medicare Part B effective date - you must have both Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B to buy a Medigap plan. Once you have an established Medicare Part B effective date, you will have a 6-month open enrollment period to buy any Medigap plan from any carrier with NO medical underwriting. After this point, you can buy a new Medigap plan whenever you would like (there are no annual enrollment periods for Medigap plans), however, you would have to go through medical underwriting if you don't qualify for a special enrollment period or a guaranteed-issue right. The best overall time to buy will be your initial open enrollment period when you're new to Medicare and just starting Part B coverage. Determining which Medigap plan is right from you and which carrier to apply for the plan through can be a bit more involved than some may realize. It's not all about price as some may believe. You need to look at the carriers' premium rating methods (community, attained, or issue age rated), their rates, their rate increase history, their service history, and other factors. It's best to consult with an experienced Medigap broker who can help you determine which plan and carrier will be most suitable to your desires, needs, and budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including providing quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."

Other than those circumstances, your policy proceeds go to the person or other entity that you chose to be your beneficiary, bypassing your estate.

When  I  Can  Withdraw  Money  From  My  401K?," Most people would want to wait until they are at least 59 1/2 years old to withdraw money from their 401k because that is the age when penalty free withdrawals can be taken.

The residents of the household will be required to be added to the policy as operators.
Why  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  More  For  Men?," Life insurance costs more for men simply because men die sooner than women on average, according to actuarial tables. The difference in rates between men and women is not as much at younger ages and for short term insurance. It is in longer term and permanent policies, and policies purchased at an older age, where the price increases for men show up more. That is because the policy is insuring the male to an older age, and the chances of mortality are higher."
What  Is  A  Endowment  Plan  In  Life  Insurance?," Endowment plans are designed to really push the cash accumulation inside your policy. Why would you want to do that? I mean after all, the purpose of life insurance is to provide the survivor benefit you need, when it is needed, for the best price available. Each dollar of benefit literally costs pennies. It is a great deal. So how does cash fit into this picture? It can be superb icing on the cake. Solid whole life products provide great guarantees on the cash accumulation. Solid whole life companies provide some hefty dividends on a non-guaranteed basics. Universal life can provide not only attractive cash accumulation, but some pretty interesting distribution options. And according to current tax law, all this money can be available with little or no taxation. (Ask your attorney if you dont believe me). BUT certain rules have to be followed if you want to keep Uncle Sam out of the picture. An endowment contract could very well trigger a taxable event. When a policy endows, it could exceed the threshold of growth that the government authorities allow before they tax you. A pretty good sign this has occurred is when the cash value equals the death benefit. Is this necessarily bad? It doesnt have to be. If you get the proper advice from your broker and your tax advisor, this could be a planned event in which you still benefit. Even considering the tax you will have to pay, you could still be way ahead of the game financially. However, if you really want to avoid a taxable event, your insurance company will help you. They really dont want to be sued by you or anybody else who mistakenly gets a tax bill you dont want to pay. They will give you illustrations to your hearts delight with all kinds of red flags screaming endowment! endowment! endowment! You can then plan accordingly. To endow, or not to endow. That is the question :)"
How  Much  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  For  Seniors?," The cost of life insurance for seniors is much higher than for persons in their 20's and 30's, because the mortality rates for seniors are much higher than for young adults. However, if you are a senior person in good health, or with a very well controlled health condition, there are companies that will cater to you. E.g. Getting type 2 diabetes at age 70 could enable you to still get Preferred rates with a few companies, whereas that would not be likely if you got type 2 diabetes at age 20. If you are a senior in good health and you want more coverage than just for your funeral, it can be worth it to use a medically underwritten policy. But be prepared to have an EKG, answer simple questions to test memory (e.g. who is the president of the US), and have all your medical records reviewed. Using an agency that specializes in senior life insurance can help you jump all the hurdles to get your best rate. For small, no exam final expense policies, the rates for seniors will depend a lot on your age and whether you are male or female. You can expect to pay from $50/mo to $200/mo for a burial policy, on average."
When  To  Use  Your  Home  Insurance?," You can make a claim against your homeowners policy any time that you experience a loss as a result of one of the covered perils.

What  Happens  When  I  Cancel  Life  Insurance?," When you cancel your Life Insurance policy, you are not only giving up the coverage you purchased but you may also be giving up your insurability and cost of insurance. When you applied for the coverage you are considering cancelling, you went through underwriting to determine if you are insurable. While you are insured, if your health was to deteriorate, the insurance company still maintains the coverage you have. If after cancelling your policy, your health starts to suffer, then when you try to reapply for another Life Insurance policy, you may not be insurable and at best you will have to pay more in premium. Plus consider you will be older which also increases your premium. I recommend that you talk to your broker/agent first to discuss your situation and see the alternatives you have."
What  Happens  If  I  Cancel  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," If you cancel a life insurance policy, first and foremost, the policy will not pay a death benefit to your beneficiary if/when you pass away.

However, if you took it out within the year, your agent may lose all their commission from that sale and could be penalized by the insurance company. With Whole or Universal Life, there will be a surrender charge that reduces the cash value you would collect upon cancelling your policy. However, you may be able to roll your full cash value over into a new policy. Or you may have the option to change your policy to a reduced paid-up policy, in which you get to keep some death protection even though you are no longer paying a premium. Discuss your options with your agent. you may be surprised at the options you have."

If a state allows an illegal immigrant to obtain a drivers license, then that person can obtain auto insurance. If the person cannot obtain a drivers license from that state, he cannot obtain auto insurance and even being behind wheel is illegal. Political debates aside, an illegal immigrant should find a state where he/she can register for a drivers license and get auto insurance.

Over a great many years, statistics have tended to show that younger less experienced male drivers tend to be involved in more claims than their young, less experienced female counterparts. That being the case, and all other things being equal, it would cost more for a male to insure a car than it would for a female to insure the same car."
Can  I  Rent  A  Car  From  Enterprise  Without  Insurance?, If you do not have your own insurance policy to protect you when you rent a car you do have the option to purchase the insurance provided by the rental car company.

How  Much  Is  Term  Life  Insurance  For  20  Years?," There's many factors that go into the premiums for life insurance to say what a policy costs - it will be different for every person as we each have our own specific needs. The premium for a policy will depend on the insured's age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for (in this case, 20 year term insurance), their riskclassification (determined by your medical history), and whether they'reapplying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends ona number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has their own set of underwriting guidelines and mortality tables, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). Non-medical term life insurance policies will almost always cost much more than fully underwritten policies that require an exam because an insurance company is taking on more risk without having a full medical picture of you. Consult with an experienced life insurance broker to determine what coverage is appropriate/suitable for your needs and budget. Please feel free to contact me for help or if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
What  Is  The  Term  Of  Life  Insurance?," If you actually buy Term Life Insurance, you get to pick the term, be it one year, five years, ten years, or even twenty years. But you need to pay the premium every year, or it will end. 97% of folks do not continue to pay and it ends for them. They then have to get another policy, only to find it costs more because they are older, or is not even available because of their health. A man in his 30's put off buying until last week, only to find he had developed MS and had to pay a much higher premium. He was lucky to be able to get insurance at all. Do not put off buying insurance. Something is always better than nothing. Getting Permanent Whole Life Insurance is the safest. The rates never go up and you can keep it your entire life, so long as the premiums are paid. A quality agent can help you determine what you can afford, and how to arrange a variety of possible alternative options. Gary Lane, Agent for New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thank you."
What  Is  An  Annual  Premium  For  Home  Insurance?," Great question. If you are asking what is...the cost...for a homeowner's policy, this may help you.

What  Kind  Of  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?," There are many choices of life insurance available to you. The main stream life insurance products are term life, universal life, variable life and whole life. Each one has a specific purpose. Term life insurance is meant to coverage a specific period of time. The common terms are 1-5-10-15-20-25-30-35 years. This means the rate or premium you purchase is guaranteed level for that period of time regardless of change in health, life style or occupation. Term life is commonly used for younger people starting out in life, covering a large debt, life a mortgage on a home or business debt, or covering for a young child's education. term life insurance allows for the largest face amount for the smallest premium payments. Universal life and variable life are permanent life insurance solutions that build cash value. Typically the premiums are more expensive and the face amounts are less because part of the premium is going into a cash value fund that can be invested with numerous options. The cash value can later be used for retirement, college funds, critical or chronic illness or even to purchase a large asset like a home. The universal and variable options are typically more aggressive with the cash value funds. The last option, whole life insurance, is very similar to the previous universal life insurance options. However, the cash value funds are typically a fixed percentage of growth. Whole life as it's name suggests is primarily meant to cover you for your entire life. I recommend using an experienced independent life insurance broker with numerous carriers to shop the market and find you the best product at the best price for your unique situation. Good luck."

All licensed agent are ethically obligated to provide information that helps the proposed client make a decision that is in their best interest not that of the agent."
Who  Should  Be  Beneficiary  On  Life  Insurance?," It depends on the reason for the policy. Most people will select a spouse, parent or other family member. If the policy is for final expenses you can name the person who will be handling those affairs or even the funeral home. I do not recommend naming a child as beneficiary unless the money is earmarked for the child after he or she turns 18. Money left to the child will be held in trust until the child is of legal age."
Can  You  Be  Dropped  From  Group  Health  Insurance?," Yes, but not just because someone in the front office feels like picking on you that day. There would have to be some change in your eligibility status or what the company's policy is to trigger such an event. For example, you had your working hours reduced below 30 hours per week and this puts you below both your employer's and the Federal government's definition of what a full-time eligible employee is (30 or more hours per week defines a person as full-time for benefits eligibility under ObamaCare). This could trigger your still being an employee but no longer being eligible for their group health insurance plan. If you are responsible for paying a portion of your health insurance premium (and most employees are these days) and for some reason you are unable to pay your share of the premium (usually hard to do since these payments are generally taken out on a payroll deduction basis) then you could be terminated for non-payment of premium. Of course, if your employer decides to terminate their group health insurance plan entirely and you are dropped from coverage because a group plan no longer exists at your workplace you are obviously dropped. Though usually even small employers will try to give advance notice and employers (especially larger ones) are required to give a certain amount of advance notice of a plan change or termination. But you can't be dropped from your employer's coverage in an arbitrary manner while still an employee meeting all the eligibility requirements set forth under your employer's personnel policies and state and Federal laws. For example, you couldn't be terminated from the health insurance plan simply because your were running up a lot of expenses for your cancer treatment."

What  Is  Supplemental  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance?," A supplemental disability insurance is a personally owned long term disability policy usually purchased to supplement a group employer sponsored long term disability plan. You are basically supplementing your existing group plan with a personally owned policy. The reason this is necessary is because most group plans only cover 50- 60% of an employees income. A supplemental policy will provide additional coverage in addition to the group plan. The amount of supplemental disability coverage you can purchase is limited based on the insurance carriers guidelines. This is determined by the amount of your income your group plan covers and weather or not you pay for your group plan or your company does. As a general rule, most carriers won't let you insure more than 70% of your gross annual income."
Can  Married  Children  stay  On  Parents  Auto  Insurance?, Generally married children cannot be on the parents policy. What happens if you try to hide this material fact and you have an accident and now you need to file a claim?

If you or your spouse have a vehicle and you have the car financed in your name and your parents are not on the note-can you say Red Flag?

When  Are  Life  Insurance  Proceeds  Taxed?," In most cases, life insurance proceeds, the death benefit, are received income tax free by the beneficiary in most cases.

Common exceptions include business-owned life insurance issued, or materially modified, after August 17, 2006 which may be taxable unless specific steps are taken during time of application and annually thereafter to meet conditions which allow the proceeds to be income tax-free. Another exception is a tax trap where life insurance contracts with three parties involved may also have unexpected taxable implications."
Is  Accidental  Life  Insurance  Worth  It?," Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) and accidental death benefit (ADB), either as a stand alone policy or as a rider on a life insurance policy, is inexpensive but I question its value. In some instances, it may make sense to the buyer. I don't follow industry sales data at this granular a level but I can safely say that it is neither offered nor sold as much as it was in the past when our economy was more industrial and agrarian than service oriented the way it is today."
Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tummy  Tuck?, A tummy tuck will be covered under your health insurance plan as long as it is considered (and coded) as medically necessary by your attending physician. Often times this is considered an elective procedure and won't be covered. It's vital to contact your carrier prior to the procedure to find out how (if at all) they will cover the surgery. The best place to start is to call the benefits verification or pre-certification phone number on the back of your insurance cards.
Does  Health  Insurance  Typically  Cover  Otoplasty?," Health insurance may cover otoplasty, although in most cases it does not. If it is considered cosmetic (and usually it is), it may not be paid or covered under a typical policy.

Life insurance is paid directly to the benefactresses of the life insurance policy.

If the proceeds remain with the surviving spouse, they are subject to federal and state estate taxation if the proceeds and all other assets exceed the federal unified credit and the state exemptions.If that possibility exists, then the policy or policies should be owned day one by an Irrecoverable Life Insurance Trust to avoid inclusion in the estate."
When  Do  You  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?," The time to get DI is different for everyone depending on your occupation and health. The best answer is ... as soon as possible. DI is cheaper the younger you are, plus you never know if you might become sick or injured. If you're worried that you might make more money in the future, you can add a rider on your policy that will make you eligible for more coverage at a later date, or you can simply try to buy more DI when the time comes (assuming you don't have any serious medical issues when that time does come)."
How  Do  I  Know  What  Health  Insurance  I  Have?," Your policy provides your health plan information - it'll tell you the carrier name, your policy number, plan details including premiums, copayments, coinsurance, deductible, maximum out-of-pocket expense.

If you're looking for new coverage, I always recommend consulting with an experienced broker to make sure that what you have provides good coverage and meets your needs and budget. Experienced brokers will have an in-depth knowledge of products from multiple carriers, can review a wide range of options with you, and help you determine which program will best serve your needs. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
What  Is  The  Average  Salary  Of  A  Life  Insurance  Agent?," That's a great question! An insurance agent most often works off of a payment that is made to them when they sell a policy or product for the company - called a commission. These commissions can be fairly sizable, or very small, depending upon the sale. Therefore, in most cases, the earnings of the insurance agent depend entirely upon their ability to sell, and the product commission that is paid upon the sale. I believe the vast majority of agents will tailor the right product to the needs of the client, but there will unfortunately always be a few that are more interested in commission than client. You are always wise to have an idea of what it is that you want, and if you feel pressured, to ask for time to think it over. Follow your instincts. If you were considering a career as an agent, be aware that the start up period can be really lean until you've gotten your client base built, and you may need to have another source of income, especially if you were accustomed to a steady paycheck. Once you get rolling, if you are motivated, honest, and good with your clients, you can make a very comfortable living. Anything I can do to help, I'm happy to - feel free to contact me. Thanks for asking!"

Do you have substance abuse problems with drugs oralcohol? Do you have a felony? Is your credit good? Just to name a few of the factors that enter into the price tag of lifeinsurance."
Should  I  Buy  Life  Insurance  When  I  Am  Young?," Life insurance is always cheapest now. The exception would be a smoker who quits, then applies a year later. Of course going without insurance for that year carries the risk of dying during that time without providing for yourfinal expenses, or thefinancial needs of loved ones. Do it now."

What  Kind  Of  Health  Insurance  Is  Best?," The best type of health insurance really depends on your circumstances. For example, generally healthy individuals with additional cash on hand are often best suited by High Deductible Health Insurance Plans as they can cover the high deductible if in the rare chance they should require considerable health care. The deductible acts as a stop loss against their total risk of expense exposure. Individuals with less cash on hand, and or those with medical conditions that require more frequent trips to the doctor are generally better suited by Managed Health Care systems like Heath Maintenance Organizations or Preferred Provider Organizations with low deductibles and/or co-pays."
Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  STD  Testing?," Coverage for testing/screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has been standard practice in the group and individual health insurance marketplaces for many years. What is covered and how may have varied from state to state. Under the requirements of ObamaCare, health insurance policies compliant with that law will have to cover testing for HIV and a variety of other STDs. So, certainly, policies purchased on or after January 1, 2014 should offer rather extensive coverage for STD testing and in most cases one would expect testing/screening to be covered under the preventive care requirements of ObamaCare which means 100% coverage with no copays, deductibles or co-insurance cost sharing. Testing done for treatment purposes and monitoring after an initial diagnosis has been made are then subject to the plan's treatment coverage provisions. So, the very same test done at no charge to diagnose an STD may be subject to a copay, deductible and/or co-insurance when done in conjunction with chronic disease management/treatment."

Should  Car  Insurance  Increase  Every  Year?," If the cost of auto repairs hasnt increased and damages awarded in lawsuits hasnt increased, auto insurance probably shouldnt increase. Your state insurance commissioner keeps a close eye on insurance cost in your states. He does this for two reasons. The first is to make sure that the public isnt being charged too much and the second is to make sure that the insurance companies are taking in sufficient money to honor all of the promises that they have made. The real cost of automobile insurance is determined when you have a claim. If the policy limit is exceeded and angry people are suing you, you paid too much for your insurance. If your policy had high limits and took care of everything, then you bought cheap insurance. Having to settle a claim out of your own pocket is the most expensive form of insurance that you can purchase. The reason that insurance premiums increase is that the company pays out more than it can afford to pay out. It is a simple balance sheet calculation. When the company finds that they are paying out more in claims than they are receiving in premiums they file with the state insurance commissioner to review and adjust rates in your state. Several things cause the claims experience of a company to increase. It could be that the frequency of claims increases. This could be the result of reduced safety enforcement, poorer road conditions or a variety of other causes. It could be that the severity of claims has increased. This would be the result of an increasing number of accidents turning into lawsuits. It also could be caused by juries making increasingly high awards to those injured in accidents. It also could be the result of increased medical costs in your area. Another factor could be the cost of auto repairs. Materials and parts tend to become more expensive over time and this could affect the claims experience of a company. It is important to note that most companies in the state will feel similar pressure at the same time as those factors affect all the companies. There are moral factors that also come to affect the premiums of auto insurance. When drivers report fewer annual miles than they actually drive, that increases their exposure without increasing the premium for their policy. If people allow other drivers to operate their vehicles without adequate supervision of screening risky drivers could be populating the streets. Even though your state requires that vehicles be insured we all know that some are not and that expense has to be shared somewhere. A frequent abuse is the pizza delivery man who is driving the family sedan. His insurance policy never knew he was doing that and has a risk that hasnt been properly evaluated. There are far more lurid cases but my all-time favorite is the family sedan that has steel tanks welded underneath the body to carry illegal liquor. All these moral issues also affect the premium."
Which  Is  Better  Medicare  Or  Medicare  Advantage?," Original Medicare, with or without a supplement plan, allows you to use any doctor, lab or hospital anywhere in the U.S. that accepts Medicare assignment.

What  Will  Void  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," what will void a life insurance policy ? Basically any deciet given during the application process will void a policy if found out within the first two policy years.

Other states may have something similar."

Can  Home  Insurance  Cover  Plumbing?, Homeowners insurance will not cover plumbing for normal wear and tear. In other words if the pipes just get old and you need new pipes they are not covered. If a pipe were to burst suddenly and flood your kitchen for example the insurance would pick up the damage caused by the water but will not fix the pipe. This is assuming of course water damage is not excluded from your policy.
How  To  Get  Health  Insurance  For  A  LLC?," Purchasing health insurance for an LLC is no different than applying for an individual or group health insurance plan. If the LLC has few or one one employee then individual policies would make the most financial sense. If the LLC wants to provide benefits for all its employees then either a small group plan or a defined benefit plan will make sense. Group's plans require an in depth fact finding analysis to uncover the true needs of the group. Important factors include: Size of the group Number of employee participating Amount employer wants to subsidize - if any? Type of benefits Are employees local or spread out among states The new trend in 2014 for small group is setting up a defined contribution plan (section 105 plan) where the employer subsidizes a set amount to employees tax-free and the employees use that money to offset their health insurance premium, costs etc for the individual plans they purchase."
How  To  Set  Up  A  Trust  For  Life  Insurance?," To set up an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT), it is best to use an attorney who is an expert at tax laws to set up the trust. Then use a respected life insurance agent to help you obtain a policy, or transfer existing life insurance, into the trust. You will need to choose a trustee to administer the trust (this could be the lawyer). Working together, you will get a trust that works for your lifetime."
Can  You  Get  Medicare  While  Working?," Yes, you can be on Medicare while working.

Self-employed individuals will usually go on Medicare when they turn 65 unless they have group coverage available through their spouse's work. Some may decide to go on Medicare if they're 65 and still working because they want a more predictable health expense structure and/or want to lower their premiums."
Where  Do  I  Buy  Life  Insurance?," You can buy life insurance online, by mail, or by meeting with an agent at their office or your home. Life insurance policies that are purchased without any contact with an agent are usually simplified issue policies. They generally are for smaller face amounts and do not require an exam. While the transaction can be simple, it takes a pretty insurance savvy person to read and understand all the fine print. Thus, it is easy to get declined, or not get the price or policy you were seeking. I recommend calling an agency that carries both simplified and fully underwritten policies, so that you can ask questions and will be given an accurate description of each type of policy before you make your decision. Most types of life insurance can be purchased online or by meeting with an agent face to face. Looking at testimonials and checking Better Business Bureau ratings can be helpful in determining which agency you want to patronize. Reading answers from different agents on this website is also a good way to meet us and decide for yourself who appears to be knowledgeable and trustworthy."
What  Makes  Car  Insurance  Cheaper?," If you are asking what helps keep your auto insurance rates lower, then there are many factors that can help with this.

A married person will typically have lower rates than a single person. There are many other factors can come into play here also, but these are some of the most prominent ones."
How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Claim  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," Death claims are handled quickly. The company needs a death certificate and in some cases a simple form.

Ultimately a court will decide when the insurance company should honor the claim and to whom the proceeds should be paid."
"I  am  a  non  driver  and  need  a  truck  for  my  work,  I  would  like  to  insure  my  helper  to  drive  for  me  any  problems?"," If you are insuring a vehicle for your business you can write the business auto policy and list your employee or employees as a drivers.

Can  You  Claim  Lost  Car  Keys  On  Insurance?," Yes you could if you had comprehensive coverage. However since most key costs are under the deductible amount it would not make much sense to ruin your claims free discount in order to receive $0 from the insurance company. Even if you had a $100 deductible and the electronic keys were $150, the discounts lost plus having a claim on your record would outweigh any benefit to receiving the $50."
Which  Car  Insurance  Company  Is  Best?," Car insurance companies that do business in your state are regulated by two state insurance commissioners, your state and the state where the company is domiciled. Your state commissioner is trying to allow companies to operate in your state that will keep their promises. The best auto insurance company is one that keeps its promises."
Who  Writes  Vacant  Home  Insurance?, There are many carriers that will write coverage for a vacant home. There are of course requirements/standards that the home must meet before a carrier will provide coverage.

I would suggest contacting local agents in your area to find out about availability and pricing in your area.
What  Type  Of  Water  Damage  Is  Covered  By  Homeowners  Insurance?," Not all! Accidental discharge of water and its attendant damages is normally covered. This means when there is an accidental discharge of liquids or steam from the plumbing, heating or air-conditionaing the loss is a covered loss. It is very important to understand what is not covered. Flood is one of the most common causes of loss in the US and the homeowner's policy does not cover it. Water back up such as from a blocked sewer line is not a covered loss (some companies offer the coverage as an option.) When there is repeated or continuous seepage or leakage from a system in the house that is not covered."

How is the vehicle used? How many miles are currently on the vehicle and how many miles to you drive on an annual basis? Names of any possible drivers or people living with you along with their personal information if they wish to drive the vehicle. Need to know who your current insurance is with or if you have had coverage in the past You will need to determine how much coverage you need in place and what deductibles you would be comfortable having in place. There are probably a few more questions that you would need to answer prior to binding coverage, but that is a quick list of information you should have handy when you are ready to pursue auto insurance quotations. I hope this helps and have a wondeful day. Best, Josh DeBoer Producer Fred Daniel & Sons, Inc"
Do  I  Need  Builders  Risk  Insurance  To  Purchase  A  Home  Where  We  will  Do  Major  Renovations  Before  Moving  In?," I don't recommend using the builder to purchase the builders risk policy on a renovation project. You need coverage on the existing structure and most builders would not be covering anything but the renovation amount. They would only be covering the amount of the renovation. Purchasing the policy yourself puts you in control of the policy and allows you to make sure that you are adequately covered. In looking at David's response, I am in agreement that you should be named as additional insured on the contractors general liability policy and also get a certificate for their workers compensation."
Does  Medicare  Cover  Ptosis?, There are situations where Medicare will cover Ptosis. Your eye care provider will measure the amount of droop and advise you if the surgery is a covered expense or not.

How  Much  More  Does  Medicare  Advantage  Cost?, How much more than what? You can find Medicare Advantage plans from zero premium on up.

You should review the options in your county at www.medicare.gov or talk with your local insurance agent that specializes with Medicare Insurance Plans.
Can  You  Change  From  Medicare  Advantage  To  Medigap?, You can disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan and switch back to Original Medicare from January 1 thru February 14 of each year. You will need to get a Medicare Supplement and Prescription Drug Plan. If you have serious health conditions you may not be qualify for a Medicare Supplement. Depending on the pre-existing condition you could be denied coverage or have to pay a much higher premium because of the pre-existing condition. It would be very important to talk with a qualified agent before you make your decision to disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan.
Will  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Mold  Damage?," There are hundreds of species of mold common to the United States. Small areas of visible mold that build up on moist areas in a home not only look bad but are also a health risk, the mold may cause allergy like symptoms and/or breathing difficulties. Basic home insurance policies, generally limit coverage for mold or exclude it. It is very easy for mold to grow given suitable conditions in a home that doesn't show pride of ownership. mold claims became so excessive in prior years, the insurance industry chose to limit or exclude coverage rather than raise premium to address the growing claims. Although the standard coverage will vary from State to State as well as vary between insurance carriers, it is important to view your specific insurance policy to find out if there is coverage for mold and what the limit is.In some cases, a carrier will actually allow an extended amount of coveragefor an additional premium. It is best to maintain a clean and moisture free structure to prevent the growth of mold. In homes with a basement, it is important to remove all moisture as quickly as possible following any leaks. The Federal EPA recommends homeowners clean up any area affected by mold which is less than 10 square feet using bleach or a suitable product, any area larger than that should involve a professional."
What  Insurance  Will  I  Need  In  Retirement?," Your insurance needs do not disappear at retirement although the coverage amounts may change. Car Insurance, home owners insurance, health insurance and life insurance all play a part in a solid financial plan. You should contact an Agent and have them conduct an Insurance preview. The last thing you want in retirement is to be paying for something that you really don't need to."
What  Is  A  Cafeteria  Plan  For  Health  Insurance?," A cafeteria plan refers to the section 125 of the tax code. A cafeteria plan allows you to have dollars deducted from your payroll at your employment to pay for some health insurance costs with pretax dollars like child care or prescriptions and doctor visits expenses, and to save for retirement. While the plans may vary from employer to employer in exact details you would be smart to utilize that cafeteria plan. One word of caution- make sure any dollars saved if not used this year rolls over to the next year and that you DO NOT LOSE THE DOLLARS"
What  Auto  Insurance  Is  Required  By  Law?," If you live in a state that requires auto insurance typically the coverages that would be required are bodily injury, property damage, and uninsured motorist at minimum. Regulations are different from state to state. The amounts and types of coverage can vary greatly. Contact a local agent to know what the coverage requirements are for the state that you reside in."
Does  My  Medicare  Cover  My  Wife?, Your wife must be qualified for Medicare to receive benefits. If you are over 65 and on Medicare she can qualify based on your work history. If your wife is not yet 65 or Social Security Disability then she will have to pick up a private insurance plan until she is eligible for Medicare. She cannot be covered by your benefits.
What  Are  The  Coverage  Characteristics  Of  Home  Insurance?," A home is the largest single purchase that most people make in their lifetime. There are two characteristics that make home ownership difficult. The first is that the ownership of a home creates a situation of responsibility where you become responsible for personal injury and property damage that comes out of home ownership. For example, someone enters you home, slips on a rug and falls. Injuries can be minor or severe. It is quite possible that you could be sued to recover the loss sustained by the person who fell. This is a liability loss. The second is that you have an enormous amount of your money and the mortgage companys money invested in the home. It is usually a multiple of your annual income and would represent a great financial loss were the home to be destroyed. Your mortgage company is particularly concerned about losing their collateral and will require hazard insurance to protect their interests to the greatest extent possible. The list of things that could happen to damage a residence is lengthy but most of the causes or perils are contained in the HO-3 Homeowners policy. There are notable exceptions which should be restated. You are probably not covered for damage caused by earthquake or flood. These coverages are available but in slightly different forms and often with different policies. Because an individual cannot sustain the personal loss of a law suit or the destruction of their property they turn to an insurance company to pool their risk with hundreds of thousands of other residences. This recognizes the probability of damage and spreads that risk over a large number of residences. The insurance company charges enough to be able to pay those losses when they occur. Your state insurance commissioner is very concerned about the adequacy of the insurance companies admitted in your state. While there are various types of home insurance policies, I will confine my comments to the most common, the HO-3 Homeowners policy. Coverage A in a homeowners policy covers your residence. The coverage includes additional items but does not cover land or water. It doesnt cover trees except as covered in incidental coverages. Coverage B covers related structures on the property. It has the same restrictions as Coverage A and doesnt cover any business structures, except for a residence on the property that you lease to others. It covers you garage Coverage C covers the personal property that you either own or are responsible for. This is a very important coverage and contains internal limits on selected classes of property such as money, securities, jewelry, guns and watercraft. Misunderstandings often arise about this coverage and it should be discussed thoroughly with your insurance agent. Modifications of this coverage are relatively inexpensive and an unpaid claim is an expensive way to discover that you werent adequately covered. Coverage D pays the necessary and reasonable increase in living cost you incur when your household meets with an insured loss. The company will try to get you back into your residence as quickly as possible but will make sure that you are able to maintain your normal standard of living during the repairs. Coverage D also covers the loss of rents you might experience in the event of a covered loss. If you have an apartment on the premises and it is damaged by a covered loss, this section would apply. There are other limits and extensions in this section that require your attention if you are leasing property. There are number of ancillary coverages including credit cards, trees, fire department charges, debris removal, emergency removal of covered property and grave markers. There are several pages of definitions and exclusions which should be read. Most confusion arising from a homeowners policy come from this part of the policy. Many people think that a homeowners policy pays for routine maintenance or deterioration. Coverage L covers personal liability and provides that the company will pay up to the limits for expense that you are liable for because of bodily injury or property damage that happens on your premises. Coverage M covers medical payments to others and provides necessary medial expenses if they are incurred on your property and result in bodily injury. There are several pages of definitions and limitations on liability coverage. The policy then defines your responsibilities. You must notify the company of a loss, you must cooperate and many other responsibilities. At the back of the policy are a number of endorsements which changes the policy. These apply to specific types of property such as trading cards, animals, a roof and others. Together the HO-3 Homeowners policy is a package of protection that is sufficiently broad to meet the requirements of both lenders and homeowners. Special additional coverages are offered and should be considered. Many of these additional coverages can be included in the basic policy."
What  Is  Survivorship  Universal  Life  Insurance?," The only thing that separates this from other policies is the word survivorship. What this means is that the policy covers at least 2 individuals and it only pays a benefit with the last one dies. Survivorship policies are usually smaller face amount policies taken out by couples with larger estates. The reason they do this is to use the death benefit to cover or offset estate taxes for their heirs. I have personally not seen one done with a universal life policy. Reason being is the cost. In a majority of cases, it would probably be more cost-effective to use a traditional whole life policy for this purpose."
Does  Medicare  Pay  For  A  Walker?, Yes - Medicare covers walkers under Part B as durable medical equipment (DME) when prescribed by your doctor for use in your home. Medicare will generally pay approximately 80% of the costs - you would be responsible for the other 20%. A Medicare supplement (Medigap) plan can help cover the expenses you're responsible for paying.
How  Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  As  A  High  Risk  Driver?, Just because you are a high risk driver doesn't mean you can't find auto insurance. As long as you have a valid driver's license and are willing to pay the required premium you should be able to find coverage. Call a local agent to find out more about coverage availability and pricing.
Which  Annuity  Is  Right  For  Me?," You have to establish product suitability before deciding on any product, much less an annuity, which should be purchased as an ultimate income product. Product suitability is based on your personal financial profile, risk tolerance and economic goals. Those three areas comprise the fundamental approach to selecting the right annuity. Annuities use differing crediting methods such as interest rates, indices (both domestic and foreign) and separate sub accounts that use equities and bond allocations."
Can  You  Get  Life  Insurance  While  Pregnant?," I just asked this question of several companies for someone I know and the answer is yes. The rating will the same as if you were not pregnant, if in the first trimesters. There are also no exam policies that you can get all the way through the third trimester."
Does  Medicare  Insurance  Cover  Dental?," Routine dental checkups, cleanings, dental x-rays, crowns, etc. are not covered under original Medicare (parts A & B). You would need to buy a separate dental insurance plan to cover these benefits. If you have a medically necessary procedure completed in a hospital such as the repair of a broken jaw, then Medicare would cover it because it was an emergency situation. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  If  I  Have  Diabetes?, Yes you can. The rate will depend on age of onset and degree of control. You will probably pay a higher rate but you can get insurance. A good independent life insurance agent or broker can look at your individual situation and find a company that is affordable for you.
What  Company  Has  The  Best  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?," The best long term care insurance company and its product must be determined by gender, age, smoking status, health history and current health condition. That being said, there are only a half dozen or so long term care insurance companies in the brokerage market. Genworth should be considered as a leader in the long term care insurance market."
What  Is  Basic  Life  And  Ad  D  Insurance?," Basic life insurance pays a beneficiary if death of the insured person occurs by any reason (except suicide in the first two years). AD&D stands for Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance. It pays the beneficiary if death occurs by accident, or it pays the insured person if they lose a limb. Basic Life with AD&D is most likely a policy that combines both those types of insurance."
Does  Medicare  Cover  Compounded  Drugs?," In order for compounded drugs to be covered by Medicare Part D, they must be prescribed for a medically accepted indication, they must have at least one ingredient that is FDA approved, and at least one ingredient must be covered by Medicare Part D. Only that FDA approved ingredient and the fees for mixing the drug are covered by Medicare. Bulk powders are not covered."
What  Is  Participation  Rate  In  Annuities?," Generally speaking, tax deferred index annuities use domestic and foreign indices for its crediting method. But there are three crediting method types within any one policy (sometimes more) that play a role in what you receive from the indice performance: spreads, rate caps and participation percentage. Participation determines what portion of the performance is credited to the annuity policy, i.e. 70% of a 10% net return would credited 7%."
What  Is  A  5  Year  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?," As mentioned above, a 5 year term insurance is an insurance policy that is in force for 5 years then expires. It is designed for a short term need and or specifically for the purpose of converting to a Whole Life policy within that 5 year period. Most Term policies are convertible to permanent insurance and some companies limit the type of permanent insurance their term policies may be converted to. In converting a term to a permanent policy what happens is the face amount of the Term, or a portion of that amount is converted to a Whole Life or Universal life policy without the insured having to undergo additional medical testing or underwriting. The premiums paid to the Term policy are not credited to the new permanent policy and the new premium will be based on the current age of the insured."
How  Do  You  Set  Up  Annuities?," You will need to contact a good insurance agent who is familiar with annuities and can offer a multitude of companies. The agent can examine your needs, goals and personal circumstances and help determine if an annuity is suitable for you, and if so help direct you to an annuity that fits your circumstances. The agent will then help you apply."
When  Is  Permanent  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Idea?, When permanent life insurance is a good thing? That depends on who you ask! Some would say only if you have dependents or someone you want to leave an inheritance to. But the fact is that Whole Life is perhaps the safest way to grow your money! It offers a guaranteed interest rate and with mutual providers it also offers dividends. It is a much better vehicle to save and grow your money that any bank instruments - guaranteed returns and Liquid for your use. Also with tax benefits not offered anywhere else! So when is permanent life insurance a good thing...ALLways!
How  Long  Will  Disability  Insurance  Pay?, Disability insurance will pay benefits to the disabled person according to the terms of the policy that was purchased. The elimination period determines at what point payments start. This may be a few months to a year after the disability occurs. The duration of the plan dictates how long the Disability Insurance pays. This may be a few years all the way to age 65.
What  Is  Philippine  Prudential  Life  Insurance?," Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Company (Philippine Prudential) is a 100% Filipino owned financial services company. They offer endowment plans, whole life plans, group and permanent plans, healthcare coverage, education and pensions policies, and credit insurance. Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Company was established in 1963 and is headquartered in Pasig City, Philippines."
How  Much  Is  Life  Insurance  For  A  60  Year  Old?," There's many factors that go into the premium calculations for life insurance to say what coverage will cost for a 60 year old - it will be different for every person due to a number of factors including their age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for, their risk classifcation, and whether they're applying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. At age 60, you'll have term life insurance options for 10, 15, 20, or 25 years - 30 years term insurance would not be available due to age - you would need to look at permanent programs to secure coverage longer than 25 years. If you want to consider coverage beyond 25 years, I would suggest looking at a Guaranteed Universal Life insurance policy (GUL). If you're looking for something in the $100,000, 10yr term insurance range, you could be looking at premiums as low as $28 per month (at preferred plus risk class) to over $100+ per month (if you're table-rated), it ultimately depends on the risk classification you qualify for. $250,000, 15 yr term can be as low as $82 per month or over $154 per month at standard risk class. So on and so forth. However, any numbers I quote without more details regarding your medical history will be useless. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends on a number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, prescriptions you take, your height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, family medical history, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has different underwriting guidelines, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). You should always consult with an experienced life insurance broker before applying for ANY coverage. Brokers can shop the case for you among a number of insurance companies to see which one will work best for your program and help you structure a policy that will best serve your needs and your budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Can  You  Have  Two  Medicare  Supplements?," No - only one Medicare supplement plan will pay after Medicare pays. If you try to have 2 Medicare supplement plans, you're spending extra money on the 2nd plan for no reason because it won't pay any benefits. Only one supplement plan will pay. The cost of 2 plans would also be more than having 1 Medigap plan F that covers all 9 benefits at 100%. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any questions. Thanks very much."
What  Is  The  Benefit  Of  Renters  Insurance?, Renters insurance is for renters of homes and apartments as house insurance is for those who own the house. Renters insurance protects YOUR property if there is a loss from say a fire. The biggest issue is what kind of policy you have. Does your insurance give yoy replacement cost or just current value. There is a big difference. Think about what you stuff costs today versus purchasing brand new.
Does  Life  Insurance  Cover  Alcoholism?," That is a great question! The answer is yes, unless the answer on the application about drinking was falsified, (generally along the lines of have been told they have, been treated for, or prescribed medication for alcohol abuse/dependency or addiction?, or been asked to reduce the intake of or discontinue use of drugs or alcohol?) or the death occurred as a result of a crime committed while under the influence. Many policies will not pay if the death occurs because of criminal activity, and drunk driving would fall under that category. If the death occurs from long term chronic abuse, the policy should pay, but I'd have your agent confirm that for you. Thanks for asking!"
How  Much  Is  A  Good  Life  Insurance  Policy?," Asking how much life insurance cost is like asking a realtor how much a house costs. Could be $30,000 or $30 million it depends on what you want. The factors that an agent or life insurance company would need to begin the quoting process is type of policy,how much face amount, for how long, age, build, state of residence, tobacco use andgeneral health status. From there an agent or broker can get fairly close to a premium quote but understand the underwriters have the final say on your unique premium."
Does  QDRO  Apply  To  Life  Insurance?," QDRO or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order comes through the courts in a divorce case. This order typically deals with divorce settlements concerning finances and retirement plans such as IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401Ks, 403bs and cash value life insurance plans. If you or your ex spouse owns cash value life insurance, then yes, the cash value is included in QDRO calculations. In most cases, term life insurance plans are not included in these calculations because there is no value unless a death occurs. You or your ex spouse can also be court ordered to carry a term life policy to cover alimony and or child support in case of an early death."
Can  An  80  Year  Old  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?, The time to purchase Long Term Care is when you are healthy and in your fifties or sixties. I do not know of any company that will issue a Long Term Care Policy to an eighty year old and if there were the premium would be extremely high. There are some alternatives however. Some companies will offer Short Term Care or Home Health Care policies up to age 85. While not as comprehensive as a full Long Term Care policy they can help with the high cost of care when needed. There are also other planning solutions that can help. A Long Term Care Resource Planner can help find a solution.
Can  You  Cash  Out  A  Retirement  Plan?," Certainly if it is your retirement plan you can cash out. However, there are many things to consider. If you are younger than 59.5 years old you will incur income taxes and a 10% penalty plus the fees associated from companies and advisors who will charge withdrawal fees and surrender charges. It is not advised just to cash out a retirement plan at any age. I highly recommend finding a trusted advisor to walk you through this process."
Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Foreclosure?, Renters nor any other property insurance is designed to insurance against a foreclosure. I have to assume since you arereferencinga renters policy that you are the tenant and your landlord is beingforeclosedon forcing you to move out.Unfortunatelyform an insurance standpoint there is nothing that can be done and you will have to startshoppingfor a new home. Yourrenterspolicy can betransferredto your new address. I would further discussthesituation with your local agent.
What  Is  Private  Disability  Insurance?," Private Disability Insurance is Disability Insurance that is purchased privately vs being supplied by the insured person's employer in a group policy. Persons who are self employed, or who do not have group Disability Insurance because their employer does not offer it, are most likely to buy private Disability Insurance."
Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Pool  Damage?," Your homeowners insurance policy covers damages that are caused by specific perils. While it is possible that damage to a swimming pool could be caused by fire or another of the covered perils, I doubt that is the point of this question. Most swimming p0ool difficulties arise from earth movement and that is an excluded peril in most policies."
Why  Would  I  Need  A  Medigap  Policy?," Medicare Part A & Part B only covers about 80% of the cost of your healthcare. In addition, the 20% that you are responsible for does not have a limit. No max out of pocket or cap so if something major happens you could be left with a lot of very expensive medical bills. Millions of Americans age 65 and over buy a Medigap policy to cover what Medicare Part A & B does not. There are several plans to choose from but all Medigap Plans have a letter such as Plan F, Plan G, Plan J, etc. If it doesn't have a letter it's not a Medigap Policy. I would be happy to answer any other questions you have."
Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  The  Furnace?," It is always a good idea to talk with your Insurance Professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy. In general, however, if the damage is caused by a covered peril in your policy, then more than likely there would be coverage for such damage. Keep in mind, however, that a Home Insurance policy is not a maintenance agreement nor does it include coverage for normal wear and tear. In other woreds, if the liner fails resulting in water damage to your property or personal property, the water damage would be covered subject to your deductible, but not the repair or replacement of your furnace."
Does  Medicare  Pay  For  LPC?," No, Medicare does not pay for LPC's, or Licensed Professional Counselors, at this point in time. Legislation has been proposed to include payment for LPC's under Medicare part B. As of now, only Licensed Clinical Social Workers, PhD Psychologists, and Psychiatrists are able to be reimbursed by Medicare for persons needing counseling."
How  To  Cancel  Scotia  Life  Insurance?," To cancel Scotia Life Insurance or any other life insurance policy, the best way to cancel it is to call, email, or write the company to inform them that you are cancelling it. Their website lists their life insurance contact number as 800-387-9844. However, if you are unable to reach them, you can simply quit paying your premium and the policy will lapse by itself after one month of unpaid premium."
How  To  Know  If  Someone  Had  Life  Insurance?," To find out if someone had life insurance you will have to do some digging and asking. Most people respect making that purchase and keep a record of it somewhere. Relatives may know. You could contact a local insurance agency where that person did business. If all else fails, unclaimed life insurance will eventually be turned over to the unclaimed property files in the state where the policy was purchased."
How  Does  Health  Insurance  Affect  The  Retirement  Behavior  Of  Women?," Great question! While I do not have a degree in sociology or statistics, I can tell you what I see, working daily with retired, or near retirement aged women clients. Each and every one of them appreciate it. Most of them are no longer working, though almost all of them had expected to be. The ones that still have insurance through work or their spouses work are not burdened with the fear of being unable to get medical services. The rest of them are enrolled in Medicare, or Medicaid. Those ladies also are profoundly grateful to be able to receive medical care that is affordable. Many of those women struggle to balance medical costs with the everyday expenses of heat, food, and electricity though, as the benefits are often not enough even with Social Security to make ends meet. Without health insurance they would be in a very bad way. If this did not answer your question, (And I'll admit I'm not sure what you are asking, since having insurance or not having it probably affects them the same way it would a man, or someone younger) please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to discuss this with you further. Thanks for asking!"
Is  A  Chiropractor  Covered  By  Medicare?," Chiropractic care is covered by Medicare in some situations. Medicare Part B pays for a chiropractor's manual manipulation of the spine to correct subluxation. If a hand held device is used during the manual manipulation, the use of the device is not covered. Initial physical exams, evaluations, X-rays, acupuncture, physical therapy, supplements and orthopedic devices prescribed or provided by a chiropractor are NOT covered."
What  Company  Has  The  Cheapest  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  In  Colorado?, In addition to Peggy's answer I would also look at all the options that are available which may or may not make sense for your situation. There are many hybrid products now that can provide you monies to cover LTC expenses but also provide other valuable coverage or funds. Look into Life Insurance which gives you access to the death benefit what you have a chronic condition. Please be aware that before you purchase any of these products I want you to understand what is covered and what is not. I am simply saying here there are alternatives versus just purchasing a Long-Term care policy which can be cost prohibited.
How  Much  Renters  Insurance  Do  I  Need  For  An  Apartment?," That is a question I get asked everyday. It truly depends on how much stuff you own and want replaced. Many insurers have a minimum amount of coverage needed for replacement coverage to be part of the policy. Typically it is $20,000. You want to have replacement coverage so that your items are replaced with new items, not depreciated costs. A TV you purchased 3 years ago is worth much less than its replacement. A good rule of thumb to use is $10,000 per room rented. This may seem like a lot at first, but when you start adding everything up over time that you have purchased, you will see that it is reasonable."
How  Much  Home  Insurance  Is  Needed?, The amount of coverage carried on a home is determined by the cost to replace the building and contents and the requirements of your lender. In California lenders cannot require coverage in excess of the cost of replacement but when prices rise lenders sometimes pressure homeowners to carry more coverage to protect their investment. The insurance company will require an independent evaluation of the reconstruction cost and your agent is the best person to help you. There has been a great deal of discussion concerning catastrophic losses where neighborhoods or communities are destroyed. The problem then is a shortage of material and contractors to restore damaged dwellings. In these circumstances building costs can escalate quickly. If you sense that you might be in such a potential situation be sure to discuss that with your agent.
Who  Is  The  Best  Auto  Insurance  Provider?," Because insurance is regulated by each state, there really is not only one answer to that question. Insurance companies are rated online for their financial strength, and customer satisfaction by several independent reporting agencies. My company posts our results on our website here: WEBSITELINK People choose different companies for different reasons, A friendly referral, price, or special features. What is most important to you?"
Where  To  Complain  About  Home  Insurance?," If you have an agent that you trust, start there. Insurance companies respond to complaints and you can usually reach the company by mail, email or in many cases, directly through the company website. The insurance commissioner in your state is also interested in your complaint. My recommendation is to approach the three levels that I mentioned one at a time, giving each sufficient time to respond. If you complain everywhere at once, it can cause a lot of confusion."
Is  Medigap  Or  Medicare  Advantage  Better?," It depends on your personal situation. I personally like Medigap if you can afford the premiums. With Medigap you will not have to worry about networks, you can go to any doctor that accepts Medicare, and your out of pocket exposure will be much less. Medicare Advantage is a good choice for those with limited funds or those who live in an area where there are strong networks, as long as you do not travel outside the area for extended periods. Medicare Advantage has the Prescription coverage embedded in the plan (in most cases) and can have very low or no premium. A good independent agent who handles both Medigap and Medicare Advantage can help guide you. Make sure the agent handles most of the plans in your area and takes time to ask about your personal situation."
When  To  Surrender  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?," When considering the surrender of a life insurance policy you have to ask yourself some questions. Does anyone I care about suffer without this life insurance policy? Who needs my income? Who would be responsible for my debt? I am wealthy enough to be sure my loved ones are taken care of financially? If you find that there is no longer that need for life insurance, then it is time to surrender the policy. Remember the increase incash value that accumulated is now taxable as income upon surrender."
What  Is  Life  Insurance  Advantages  And  Disadvantages?," The advantages of life insurance are three fold. The death benefit proceeds can pay the bills, fund future obligations and make a difference for your children and charities. The economic leverage for a healthy insured is significant and the tax advantages considerable. The diversity of the product line can be customized to the individual consumer. The only disadvantage of life insurance, like any other product, is that you have to pay for it."
Much  Does  Health  Insurance  Cost  One  Person?," The rate depends on many factors including your age, where you live, your health and whether you smoke. Monthly rates could vary between $25 per month to $250 per month (or much higher) depending on these factors. And of course, different carriers such as Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare etc... will charge different premiums. To view rates, you can visit a reputable website that offers free online quotes. There is no obligation and you can easily apply online for coverage after viewing your best options. You may also receive a federal tax subsidy when State Exchanges are operational. Naturally, an experienced broker can also assist you."
Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  A  Broken  Laptop?," If the laptop is broken as the result of a covered peril the renters policy will pay to make it whole. The payment will be subject to the deductible and if the computer has depreciated very much your reimbursement might not be significant. If the computer is damaged by negligence or if it simply is running out of gas, then it probably wont be covered at all."
Is  Life  Insurance  Taxable  To  The  Beneficiary  In  Illinois?," Life insurance proceeds are not taxed. The proceeds are directed to the named beneficiary. This is also a great option for estate planning. Tangible assets depending on how it's structured, may be taxed. It's best to meet with a licensed professional to design a program that can eliminate taxes to be paid. Life insurance can offset any taxes to be paid."
Can  I  Be  Denied  Health  Insurance?, At this time yes you can. However that is soon to change. Beginning in January of 2014 the affordable care act mandates that no one can be denied coverage based on pre-existing conditions. You will be able to take out a policy in or out of the exchange. You also cannot be charged more premium because of your health.
Why  Do  Kids  Need  Life  Insurance?," Since the purpose of life insurance is usually to protect someone from an economic loss that would be caused by the death of the Insured person, this is a good question. Why do kids need life insurance? In light of the stated purpose, perhaps this need does not exist in your family. If the unspeakable happened and you lost a child, you may have plenty of resources to cover final arrangements, even if there were medical bills. If not, then a life insurance policy for a child, or putting the child(ren) on a child rider on your policy, would be a valid choice. However, because I specialize in Impaired Risk life insurance (life insurance for those who have health conditions or other risk), I see the biggest advantage of kids having life insurance as ensuring they will be able to get affordable life insurance for the rest of their lives. There is a huge advantage to getting them insured while they are still healthy. E.g. A child who develops type 1 diabetes will not be able to get a life insurance policy until they are at least 16 years old, and then far above average rates will follow them the rest of their lives. If they got even a term policy before developing diabetes, the policy can later be converted to a permanent policy at the same health rating they got before they were diagnosed. If on a child rider, they can get 5 times the amount of the rider rated Standard when they become adults, no health questions asked. There is a tendency to not think about life insurance until there is a scare in one's health. Having life insurance as a child just takes care of it, no matter what the future brings."
Does  Disability  Insurance  Have  A  Cash  Value?," Disability Insurance is a morbidity product with no accumulating cash values. The benefits of a disability insurance product are not considered an asset, but an insurance claim. Although most disability insurance claims are tax free, businesses that expensed the disability insurance premiums as a tax deduction, receive the benefits taxable as ordinary income."
How  Much  Life  Insurance  Should  You  Carry?," That is an excellent question! The answer is that it depends upon what you want the insurance to do for you. If it is just to cover funeral expenses, then typically a smaller, $10-20,000 policy should be fine. If you are trying to cover mortgage, college, or other major debt that would be left to your spouse, then you want at least that much. If it is to provide a legacy for your children, then however much you'd like to bless them with is the amount needed. If it is to provide your spouse with the income lost when you pass, then you will want to do some math, and decide upon how many years' salary to choose. If you need help, please contact me, okay? I'd be happy to help. Thanks for asking!"
Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Stolen  Bike?," If your personal property includes a bicycle, it will be covered under a renters policy. If the bicycle is stolen from your unit it will be covered to the property limit of the policy after satisfying the deductible. If you have a $400 bicycle and it is stolen, and if your policy has a $250 deductible, you can expect a settlement in the range of $150. If the bicycle is stolen from the bicycle rack in front of the Biology building then the amount of coverage is reduced to about ten per cent of the personal property limit of the policy.

What  Are  The  Benefits  Of  Having  Renters  Insurance?," That is a great question! The best reason to have renter's insurance is that they pay to replace the things that you have that become stolen or destroyed. Most of us do not have that kind of money. Another is that if your apartment was unlivable due to damage, the policy often covers your stay at a hotel until adequate repairs have been made. The last, and probably best benefit is that it is one less thing to have to worry about. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"
Where  Can  I  Get  Whole  Life  Insurance?," You can get whole life insurance from an agency or website that sells it. Try calling to ask if they sell whole life in all face amounts, and ask the ratings of the companies through which their whole life insurance is sold. It the agency only sells it up to a certain face amount, they only sell final expense whole life. That is a good choice if you need final expense coverage, but to get whole life in larger face amounts, you need to make sure you are getting a competitive product."

Insurance claim settlements are intended to pay for the repair of damage caused by a covered loss under the provisions of a policy contract, in this case an car insurance policy. If one receives a settlement and then chooses, for whatever reason not to repair the damage, I have not seen a case where an insurance company is going to be looking for it's money back. Keep in mind acouple of things, however. If you have a lien or lease on your car, the check will be made payable to BOTH you and the financial institution and they will need to have the car repaired as a condition of your agreement with them. Also, if you happen to have another incident that further damages the same car parts that were damaged previously, the claims professional will be able to tell the older damage from the more recent and will NOT include an amount needed to repair both."

While this does not always seem fair, it is legal and approved by the Department Of Insurance. Your recourse? There is an Open Enrollment in October for 2014 effective dates which should cover your pre-existing condition. Prior to that time, you could apply with another carrier to see if they would cover the condition, with an added charge.

Some non-standard policies do not include this benefit, so be careful.

How  Much  Could  Disability  Insurance  Cost?," Disability insurance depends on a number of factors. The cost (your premium) is based on a number of factors - the most important being your medical history, your job, and your income - and the policies are very customizable. This is a very important type of coverage to have that many don't think about. It protects one of your greatest assets - your ability to work.If you can't work because of an injury or illness, how do you provide income for you and your family. The answer? Your disability insurance. When you're buying a disability policy, the MOST important factor in the policy structure is the DEFINITION OF DISABILITY .Each policy will use 1 of the 3 definitions: 1) True Own Occupation - this says you are considered totally disabled if, solely due to injury or sickness, you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation, even if you are at work in another occupation. In short, this is the most favorable definition you can have. 2) Modified Own Occupation - this says that you are considered totally disabled if, solely due to injury or sickness, you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation. This one is commonly seen in many individual disability insurance policies. 3) Gainful Occupation - this says if you are unable to perform the duties of your occupation or any occupation for which you are qualified for by education, training, or experience due to sickness or injury. In short, this is the least favorable definition. This one is commonly seen in group disability insurance policies through an employer and property and casualty insurers that offer disability coverage. There are many moving parts to disability insurance and is not something I would suggest trying to buy on your own - this is a type of coverage you should consult with an experienced independent disability insurance broker about. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your coverage and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
Is  Medicare  Prescription  Drug  Coverage  Mandatory?," That is a great question! The answer is one of those , no, but you should answers. Like health insurance isn't mandatory, having it is very wise, and not having it has penalties. It iskind of like that with your prescription coverage. While it isn't mandatory to have, the cost of your prescriptions without it is often prohibitive. A prescription that Medicare covers may only cost you a couple of dollars, that without the coverage would cost $45-50 dollars or more. On a fixed income, and looking at stretching a retirement fund, I'd wholeheartedly recommend that you enroll in the plan. Thanks for asking!"

Why  Does  My  Landlord  Want  Me  To  Have  Renters  Insurance?," I think that there are two reasons. The landlord wants you to understand fully that he is not responsible for your personal property that is in the rental unit.

How  Does  It  Work  If  You  Have  Two  Health  Insurance  Policies?," For someone covered by two or more group health insurance policies, the term COB, short for coordination of benefits, would be used in such a scenario.

For this reason,coordination of benefitswas established as a method by which two or more carriers or plans could coordinate their respective benefits so the total benefit paid does not exceed 100% of the total allowable expenses incurred. In most states, thecoordination of benefitsregulations specifies how benefits are to be coordinated by insurance companies issuing group policies in the state.

The application process is simple, usually 5 yes/no questions or less. A yes answer is an automatic disqualifier. Most STM plans have a simple design of a deductible then coinsurance. A few have copays. Every one I have seen includes an Rx discount plan and some have PPO networks.

There is no renewal. Instead you apply for a new plan with new underwriting and new pre-existing limits."

How  Much  Does  An  Agent  Make  On  Life  Insurance?," That is an excellent question! Insurance agents do not draw paychecks like normal people.
